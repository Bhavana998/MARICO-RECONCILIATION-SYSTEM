# 🧾 Marico Reconciliation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a data reconciliation system designed to solve real-world challenges in FMCG companies where financial reconciliation across multiple channels is complex and time-consuming.

The system automates comparison of invoices, ledgers, and claims data to identify matched and unmatched records.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In large-scale businesses:
- Reconciliation takes weeks or months
- Data exists in multiple formats
- Heavy manual Excel usage
- Frequent mismatches in:
  - Prices
  - Quantities
  - Claims

This leads to delayed financial closure and blocked working capital.
